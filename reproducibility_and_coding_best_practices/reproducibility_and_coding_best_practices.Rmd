# Reproducibility and Coding Best Practices

Today, we are going to return to the topic of *reproducibility* that we have 
talked about all semester and discuss several important best practices you can
follow to help ensure that:

  1. Your analyses are _reproducible_: They always return the same results, in
     the same way, every time.
  2. You can easily and painlessly update your analyses and output (e.g., if you
     get new data or fix a bug or error).
     - Jenny Bryan: *"If the thought of re-running your analysis makes you ill, 
       you're not doing it right."*
  3. People can easily read your code, understand what it is doing, and follow
     your thinking as a data analyst.
  4. Future-you can easily easily read your code, understand what it is doing, 
     and follow past-you's thinking as a data analyst.
  5. Someone else (e.g., a future RA) could easily take over and keep working on
     the project or analysis.

## Reproducibility

The principle of reproducibility has been central to the way we've approached 
programming in this course. Your analyses should be be able to run without 
any manual input from you. Reproducibility has two major components.

### 1. How easily someone can reproduce output

Example: Generating a report with a plot, a table, and some results in text.

  - Worst case scenario: No source code available; have to redo everything from scratch.
  - Common scenario: Source is available, but it's incomplete (e.g.,)
  - Better scenario: Full source is available, but output is arranged in the report manually.
  - Best case scenario: Complete report output is regenerated with the click of a button.

Key concepts to live by:

  - Source is real. Output is transient. 
    - Source >> Output
    - Think of your source files (your .R files, .Rmd files, etc.) as "real".
      Think about output files (figures, CSV tables, HTML, PDF, or Word documents,
      etc.) as "transient"—things that are temporary and likely to be overwritten
      by the next run of your code.
    - Don't make changes in your output files that matter. Make those changes
      in the source.
  - When you are building a script…
    - (i.e., when you are writing code, then immediately running it and looking
      at the results)
    - This is called "working interactively"
    - Frequently kill your R session and re-run your script from the top. It should
      still work.
      - In RStudio, Session → Restart R
    - Don't save your workspace or history when exiting from R
      - Disable this in the RStudio settings. 

**What versions of packages are you using?**

Software packages are often updated, and their inputs or outputs might change
across versions. It's important to tell your readers (and future-you) what 
versions of each package you are using. The best way to do this is to include
one of these functions at the end of your report or in an appendix:

```
sessionInfo()
devtools::session_info()
```

The `devtools` version has some additional useful info and is somewhat more nicely
formatted.


### 2. How easily someone can reproduce your _frame of mind_ or _thought proccess_

_Why in tarnation did they do **that**?!?_

Beyond just being able to reproduce the same numbers, tables, figures, etc., 
reproducibility is also concerned with you others being able to reproduce the
_thinking_ that lead to code, analyses, and results. 

What do the data and variables mean? Why did you choose these analyses? Why did 
you write your code this way versus another? Being able to answer these questions
is critical to being able to trust the results. By clicking the "Knit" button,
you might be able to reproduce the numbers in the table, but are those numbers
_right_? Is there a bug in the code, does a function not work the way that the
author thought, etc.?

The way that you make sure that readers or future-you can figure out is by providing
extensive and clear _documentation_, both _within_ files (comments) and 
_between_ files (codebooks, READMEs).

Think about your documentation at three levels:

  1. The big picture
     - What is this script or function doing overall?
     - What is the broad organization of your files and folders?
  2. The walkthrough
     - For each section of code, what is it broadly doing?
     - Think of this like the headings or summaries for the block.
     - Don't get too detailed or overdescribe here. "Compute predictor
       composites" is fine.
  3. The nitty gritty
     - What exactly is a specific line of code doing?
     - Reserve this level of detail for when something is unusual or would look
       odd to someone else/future-you. 
     - If your code needs a _lot_ of comments to explain, consider re-writing
       it to be clearer.
       
For resources on documenting code, see the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).

For resources on documenting data files, check out the [codebook](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/)
package. It can automatically produce codebooks for a data file, saving you a 
lot of time. Its vignettes (e.g., for 
[SPSS](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_sav.html),
[formr](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook.html), and  [Qualtrics](https://rubenarslan.github.io/codebook/articles/codebook_qualtrics.html))
are a great resource for thinking about the type of information that a codebook
should contain. 


## Good Coding Practices

### Naming

Your variables, functions, and other objects should have clear, concise, and 
unambiguous names.

1. Pick a style for naming variables and stick with it consistently:
   - Some people use camelCase, snake_case, or period.case
   - Don't use period.case! (it can mess with some R functionality)
2. Follow consistent rules for different types of objects
   - Functions should be verbs (based on the one main thing that it does)
   - Objects (data, models, results, figures, etc.) should be nouns
   - Functions that return functions should be adverbs
3. Always use descriptive names
   - Not `foo`, `dat2`, `model_3`, etc.
4. Don't over-create
   - The more objects there are in your global environment, the more confusing 
     it will be to try to keep track of them
   - Especially if you don't follow consistent rules for when you make objects
     and how you name them
   - Use the pipe `%>%` to avoid creating unnecessary intermediate objects 
5. Don't under-create
   - If you will re-use an object more than a few times, make it once and save it
   - Avoid "magic numbers"
     - Numbers in your code that are present without any explanation as to what
       they are or where they came from
       
Bad: 

```
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
```

Good:

```
n <- 100
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- x + rnorm(n)
```
        
6. Disambiguate from left-to-right, not right-to-left
   - This makes it easier to figure out what an object is
   - It also makes it easier to complete typing a name by typing `Tab` on your keyboard
   - Bad: `canada_gdp` and `china_gdp`. 
   - Good: `gdp_canada` and `gdp_china`.


### Documenting code 

Write your code for humans. Someone reading your code should be able to figure out
what it does. This includes both writing explanatory comments and also writing
the code itself in a way that is clear about what it does.

Code that is clear and speaks for itself is called "self-documenting code". Some
ideas that make code more self-documenting include using clear variable names
and doing things one step at a time, rather than combining multiple operations
into one line. Using the tidyverse functions (e.g., `dplyr`) can also help new
R users to figure out what your code is doing in my experience.

Base R: 
    
```
mtcars[mtcars$cyl < 8, c("cyl", "mpg")]
```
        
tidyverse: 
        
```
mtcars %>% 
   filter(cyl < 8) %>% 
   select(cyl, mpg)
```

Think carefully about how detailed your comments need to be! Overly detailed
comments could be more confusing than no comments at all. They also can be hard
to keep accurate as you revise your code or if you move things around. Focus on
the high-level decisions about the programming/analysis.

  - Bad: 
    ```
    # Lag the negative affect variable twice.
    ```
  - Good: 
    ```
    # Create lagged predictors for modeling.
    ```
Also think carefully about how you need to explain your code to someone who isn't
already familiar with it—don't use say _what_ your code does, but also _why_ it 
is written the way it is. 

Don't use comments to describe what your code is doing on a low-level.

  - Bad: 
    ```
    # make data frame of cylinders less than 8, with variables 'cyl' and 'mpg'
    ```
  - Maybe okay: No comment (if the code is clear what it is doing)
    - Using the tidyverse will often be helpful here.
  - Maybe okay:
    ```
    # Select relevant cases and variables for analyses
    ```
  
  
### The DRY principle

**DRY = Don't repeat yourself**

Avoid repeating or copy-pasting the same lines of code over and over, then making
minor changes. This is prone to typos, errors, and breakage down the line. 

If you are going to do something more than once, then use functions or write 
functions to do the repetition for you.

Example: Running an analysis by subgroup

  - Bad:
    ```
    mod_wt_4cyl <- 
      mtcars %>% 
      filter(cyl == 4) %>% 
      lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)
    mod_wt_6cyl <- 
      mtcars %>% 
      filter(cyl == 6) %>% 
      lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)
    mod_wt_8cyl <- 
      mtcars %>% 
      filter(cyl == 6) %>% 
      lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .)
    ```
  - Good:
    ```
    # Requires dplyr >0.8.99 or >1.0.0
    # Install from GitHub if you don't have this version:
    #   devtools::install_github("tidyverse/dplyr")
    mods_wt <-
      mtcars %>% 
      nest_by(cyl) %>% 
      summarize(mods_wt = list(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)))
    ```
  - Good:
    ```
    mtcars %>%
      split(.$cyl) %>%
      map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x))
    ```
  - Good:
    ```
    model_cyl_subgroup <- function(data, cyl, formula) {
      data %>% 
        select(cyl == cyl) %>% 
        lm(formula, data = .)
    }
    mods_wt <- map(c(4, 6, 8), 
                   ~ model_cyl_subgroup(data = mtcars, 
                                        cyl = .x, 
                                        formula = mpg ~ wt)
    ```
    
Example: Running an analysis for each predictor

  - Bad:
    ```
    # Make some data
    dat_big_five <- psych::bfi %>% 
      select(age, O = O1, C = C1, E = E1, A = A1, N = N1) %>% 
      slice(sample(1:nrow(.), 150)) %>% 
      na.omit()
    
    mod_age_O <- lm(age ~ O, data = dat_big_five)
    mod_age_C <- lm(age ~ C, data = dat_big_five)
    mod_age_E <- lm(age ~ E, data = dat_big_five)
    mod_age_A <- lm(age ~ A, data = dat_big_five)
    mod_age_N <- lm(age ~ N, data = dat_big_five)
    ```
  - Good:
    ```
    vars_big_five <- c("O", "C", "E", "A", "N")
    mods_age <-
      dat_big_five %>% 
      summarize(across(all_of(vars_big_five), 
                ~ list(lm(age ~ .x)),
                .names = "mod_age_{col}"))
    ```
  - Good:
    ```
    model_age <- function(data, predictor) {
      data %>% 
        select(age, predictor) %>% 
        lm(age ~ . , data = .)
    }
    mods_age <- map(vars_big_five, 
                    ~ model_age(data = dat_big_five, 
                                predictor = .x))
    ```
    
These are obviously very simple toy functions, but imagine a case where you
have much more complex models or series of analyses that you will need to repeat
over and over.


### Write Tests

Make sure that your code produces the correct results. This is best done by writing
a "unit test"—give a function/bit of code some input with a known expected output
and make sure they are the same. You should write automatic tests for your code
to be sure it produces the write result. 
  - Check out the `testthat` package.
  

### Code Styling

Format your code so that it is easy to read. For example:
  - Include spaces between object names
  - Line up parallel lines of code (see the arguments in `map()` above
  - Use indentation to guide the reader through how to read your code
  
Following a style guide, such as the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)
is a good practice for making your code readable.


## Activity

Be sure that your final project follows these coding practice guidelines!

Let's check our understanding

Review the following code:

```
    # Make some data
    dat_big_five <- psych::bfi %>% 
      select(age, O = O1, C = C1, E = E1, A = A1, N = N1) %>% 
      slice(sample(1:nrow(.), 150)) %>% 
      na.omit()
    
    o_average <- mean(dat_big_five$O)
    c_average <- mean(dat_big_five$C)
    e_average <- mean(dat_big_five$E)
    a_average <- mean(dat_big_five$A)
    n_average <- mean(dat_big_five$N)
```


```{r check_understanding}

  question("Does the above code chunk follow the DRY principle?",
           answer("Yes"),
           answer("No", correct = TRUE),

           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Should you constantly be restarting your R session when creating a script?",

           answer("Yes, then I can start working on other things"),
           answer("No, restarting will delete all my work"),
           answer("No, restarting is bad."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("What is a 'magic number'?",
           answer("Numbers in your code that are present without any explanation as to what they are or where they came from", correct = TRUE),
           answer("Numbers that will create code"),
           answer("Numbers that have an explanation and which the origin is known"),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("Is it a good idea to seperate my variable names? (Example: `cool.data.set`)",
           answer("No, it will mess with some of the R functionality", correct = TRUE),
           answer("Yes, it looks good."),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("When creating variable names, which direction should our names disamiguate?",

  )
)
```
