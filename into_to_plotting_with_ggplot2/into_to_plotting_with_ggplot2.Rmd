## Getting Started

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

 * Identify the plotting framework available in R
 * Have a sense of why we’re learning the ggplot2 tool
 * Have a sense of the importance of statistical graphics in communicating information
 * Identify the seven components of the grammar of graphics underlying ggplot2
 * Use different geometric objects and aesthetics to explore various plot types.
 
### Resources
For me, I learned `ggplot2` from Stack Overflow by googling error messages or “how to … in ggplot2” queries, together with persistence. It might take you a bit longer to make a graph using `ggplot2` if you’re unfamiliar with it, but persistence pays off.

Here are some good walk-throughs that introduce ggplot2, in a similar way to today’s lesson:

 * [r4ds: data-vis](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) chapter.
    * Perhaps the most compact “walk-through” style resource.
 * The [ggplot2 book](http://webcat2.library.ubc.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=8489511), Chapter 2.
    * A bit more comprehensive “walk-through” style resource.
    * Section 1.2 introduces the actual grammar components.
 * [Jenny Bryant’s ggplot2 tutorial](https://github.com/jennybc/ggplot2-tutorial).
    * Has a lot of examples, but less dialogue.
    
    
Here are some good resource to use as a reference:

 * [ggplot2 cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
 * [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/)
    * Good as a reference if you want to learn how to make a specific type of plot.

## Orientation to plotting in R

### A little history

Traditionally, plots in R are produced using “base R” methods, the main function here being `plot()`. This method tends to be quite involved, and requires a lot of “coding by hand”. That said, for simple plots and some built-in functions, using `plot()` is great. For example, R has built-in regression diagnostics:

```{r}
mod <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(mod)
```

Then, an R package called `lattice` was created that aimed to make it easier to create multiple “panels” of plots. It seems to have gone by the wayside in the R community.

After `lattice` came `ggplot2`, which provides a very powerful and relatively un-fiddly framework for making plots. It has a theoretical underpinning, too, based on the Grammar of Graphics, first described by Leland Wilkinson in his [“Grammar of Graphics” book](http://resolve.library.ubc.ca/cgi-bin/catsearch?bid=5507286). With `ggplot2`, you can make a great many type of plots with minimal code. It’s been a hit in and outside of the R community.

 * A big advantage of `ggplot2` is that many people have written extensions for it, such as [`tidybayes`](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/articles/tidybayes.html) (for plotting distributions and intervals), [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/) (for animations and gifs) and [`ggforce`](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/) (lots of very customizable features).
 
Check out [this comparison of the three](this comparison of the three) by Joseph V. Casillas.

A newer tool is called `plotly`, which was actually developed outside of R, but the `plotly` R package accesses the plotly functionality. `plotly` graphs allow for interactive exploration of a plot. You can convert `ggplot2` graphics to a `plotly` graph, too.

There are also some non-R plotting interfaces that are useful when you need highly customized solutions, such as [D3](https://d3js.org/), accessible in R using the [r2d3 package](https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3/).

### TL;DR

We’re using `ggplot2` in DataSci.

## Just plot it

The human visual cortex is a powerful thing. If you’re wanting to point someone’s attention to a bunch of numbers, you probably won’t get any “aha” moments by displaying a large table like this, either in a report or (especially!) a presentation.

Make a plot to communicate your message!

If you really feel the need to tell your audience exactly what every quantity evaluates to, consider putting your table in an appendix. Because chances are, the reader doesn’t care about the exact numeric values. Or, perhaps you just want to point out one or a few numbers, in which case you can put that number directly on a plot.

## The grammar of graphics

You can think of the grammar of graphics as a systematic approach for describing the components of a graph. It has seven components (the ones in bold are required to be specifed explicitly in `ggplot2`):

 * **Data**
   * The data that you’re feeding into a plot.
 * **Aesthetic mappings**
   * How are variables (columns) from your data connect to a visual dimension?
   * Horizontal positioning, vertical positioning, size, colour, shape, etc.
   * These visual dimensions are called “aesthetics”
 * **Geometric objects**
   * What are the objects that are actually drawn on the plot?
   * A point, a line, a bar, a histogram, a density, etc.
 * Scales
   * How is a variable mapped to its aesthetic?
   * Will it be mapped linearly? On a log scale? Something else?
   * This includes things like the color scale
     * e.g., c(control, treatment_1, treatment_2) -> c(“blue”, “green”, “red”)
 * Statistical transformations
   * Whether and how the data are combined/transformed before being plotted
   * e.g., in a bar chart, data are transformed into their frequencies; in a box-plot, data are transformed to a five-number summary.
 * Coordinate system
   * This is a specification of how the position aesthetics (x and y) are depicted on the plot. For example, rectangular/cartesian, or polar coordinates.
 * Facet
   * This is a specification of data variables that partition the data into smaller “sub plots”, or panels.

These components are like parameters of statistical graphics, defining the “space” of statistical graphics. In theory, there is a one-to-one mapping between a plot and its grammar components, making  * this a useful way to specify graphics.

###

### Example: Scatterplot grammar

For example, consider the following plot from the gapminder data set. For now, don’t focus on the code, just the graph itself.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Life Expectancy")
```

This scatterplot has the following components of the grammar of graphics.

|   Grammar Component   |           Specification          |
|:----------------------|:---------------------------------|
| **data**              | gapminder                        |
| **aesthetic mapping** | **x:** gdpPercap, **y:** lifeExp |
| **geometric object**  | points                           |
| scale                 | **x:** log10, **y:** linear      |
| statistical transform | none                             |
| coordinate system     | rectangular                      |
| facetting             | none                             |

Note that `x` and `y` aesthetics are required for scatterplots (or “point” geometric objects). In general, each geometric object has its own required set of aesthetics.


### Bar chart grammar

Give it a go!

Consider the following plot. Don't concern yourself with the code at this point.

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  mutate(continent = fct_infreq(continent)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(continent)) +
  geom_bar() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r bar-chart-grammar, echo = FALSE}
quiz( caption = "Answer the following:",
  question("For the `data` component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`continent`"),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("`geom_bar()`"),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("For the `aesthetic` mapping component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`"),
           answer("`continent`", correct = TRUE),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("`geom_bar()`"),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("For the `geometric` object component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`"),
           answer("`continent`"),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("`geom_bar()`", correct = TRUE),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
  question("For the `scale` object component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`"),
           answer("`continent`"),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("none", correct = TRUE),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
    question("For the `statistical tranform` object component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`"),
           answer("`continent`"),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("none", correct = TRUE),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  ),
    question("For the `facetting` object component, what is the specification?",
           answer("`gapminder`"),
           answer("`continent`"),
           answer("`theme_bw()`"),
           answer("none", correct = TRUE),
           random_answer_order = TRUE,
           allow_retry = TRUE
  )
)
```

## Working with `ggplot2`

First, the `ggplot2` package comes with the tidyverse meta-package. So, loading that is enough.

There are two main ways to interact with `ggplot2`:

 1.The `qplot()` or `quickplot()` functions (the two are identical): Useful for making a quick plot if you have vectors stored in your workspace that you’d like to plot. Usually not worthwhile using.
 
 1. The `ggplot()` function: use to access the full power of `ggplot2`.
Let’s use the above scatterplot as an example to see how to use the `ggplot()` function.

First, the `ggplot()` function takes two arguments: - data: the data frame containing your plotting data. - mapping: aesthetic mappings applying to the entire plot. Expecting the output of the `aes()` function.

The `aes()` function tells R to look in the data for variable names. Notice that the `aes()` function has x and y as its first two arguments, so we don’t need to explicitly name these aesthetics. Beyond these basic arguments, you can also specify others, such as color, alpha (transparency), size, group.

Different plot shapes (`geom_SOMETHING`) accept different `aes()` arguments. These are listed in the help file for the geom function: `?geom_point`, `?geom_line`, etc.

You can specify values for aesthetic parameters using constants or variables from outside data by specifying them outside of `aes()`. For example, to make all of the shapes of plot blue, you can add: `color = "blue"`.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp))
```

This just _initializes_ the plot. It has the “data” and “aesthetics” part of the grammar of the plot, but we don’t see anything because we haven’t yet specified the geometries or other parts of the grammar.

You’ll notice that the aesthetic mappings are already in place (the x and y axes). Now, we need to add components by adding layers, literally using the + sign. These layers are functions that have further specifications.

For our next layer, let’s add a geometric object to the plot, which have the syntax `geom_SOMETHING()`. There’s a bit of overplotting (overlapping symbols), so we can specify some alpha transparency using the alpha argument (you can interpret alpha as needing `1/alpha` points overlaid to achieve an opaque point).

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

That’s the only `geom` that we want to add. Now, let’s specify a scale transformation, because the plot would really benefit if the x-axis is on a log scale. These functions take the form `scale_AESTHETIC_TRANSFORM()`. As usual, you can tweak this layer, too, using this function’s arguments. In this example, we’re re-naming the x-axis (the first argument), and changing the labels to have a dollar format (a handy function thanks to the `scales` package).

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", labels = scales::dollar_format())
```

I’m tired of seeing the ugly default grey background, so I’ll add a `theme()` layer. I like `theme_bw()` (you can tweak themes later, too!). Then, I’ll re-label the y-axis using the `ylab()` function. Et voilà!

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  scale_x_log10("GDP per capita", labels = scales::dollar_format()) +
  theme_bw() +
  ylab("Life Expectancy")
```

### 

```{r}
mauna <- tsibble::as_tsibble(co2) %>% 
   rename(month = index, conc = value) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.Date(month))
```

Produce a line chart showing the concentration over time. Specifically, the plot should have the following grammar components:

| Grammar Component     | Specification |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| __data__              | `mauna` |
| __aesthetic mapping__ | x: month, y: conc |
| __geometric object__  | lines |
| scale                 | linear |
| statistical transform | none |
| coordinate system     | rectangular |
| facetting             | none |

Fill in the code below, replace `FILL_THIS_IN` with the correct code.

```{r mauna-exercise, exercise = TRUE}
ggplot(FILL_THIS_IN, aes(FILL_THIS_IN, FILL_THIS_IN)) +
  FILL_THIS_IN()
```

```{r mauna-exercise-solution}
ggplot(mauna, aes(x = month, y = conc)) +
  geom_line()
```

```{r mauna-exercise-check}
grade_code()
```
## A tour of some important `geom`s

Here, we’ll explore some common plot types, and how to produce them with `ggplot2`.

### Histograms: `geom_histogram()`

Useful for depicting the distribution of a continuous random variable. Partitions the number line into bins of certain width, counts the number of observations falling into each bin, and erects a bar of that height for each bin.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: A numeric vector.
   * By default, a histogram plots the count on the y-axis. If you want to use proportion (i.e., “density”), specify the y = ..density.. aesthetic.
   
You can change the smoothness of the plot via two arguments (your choice):

 * `bins`: the number of bins/bars shown in the plot.
 * `binwidth`: the with of the bins shown on the plot.
 
Example:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)
```

### Density: `geom_density()`

Essentially, a “smooth” version of a histogram. Uses [kernels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) to produce the curve.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: A numeric vector.
 
Good to know:

`bw` argument controls the smoothness: Smaller = rougher.

Example:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()
```

### Jitter plots: `geom_jitter()`

A scatterplot, but with minor random perturbations of each point. Useful for scatterplots where points are overlaying, or when one variable is categorical.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: any vector
 * `y`: any vector
 
Example:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_jitter()
```

### Box plots: `geom_boxplot()`

This geom makes a boxplot for a numeric variable in each of a category. Useful for visualizing probability distributions across different categories.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: A factor (categorical variable)
 * `y`: A numeric variable

Example: 

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(continent, lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

### Ridge plots: `ggridges::geom_density_ridges()`

A (superior?) alternative to the boxplot, the ridge plot (also known as the “joy plot”, but don’t use that term) places a kernel density for each group, instead of the box.

You’ll need to install the `ggridges` package. You can do lots more with ridges – check out [the `ggridges` intro vignette.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html)

Required aesthetics (reversed from boxplots!)

 * `x`: A numeric variable
 * `y`: A factor (categorical variable)
 
Example:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, continent)) +
  ggridges::geom_density_ridges()
```


### Bar plots: `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`

These geom’s erect a bar over each category.

`geom_bar()` automatically determines the height of the bar according to the count of each category.

`geom_col()` just takes the supplied values as the bar heights.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: A categorical variable
 * `y`: A numeric variable (only required for `geom_col()`!)
   * By default, a bar plot plots the count on the y-axis. If you want to use proportion, specify the y = ..prop.. aesthetic.
   
Example: number of 4-, 6-, and 8- cylinder cars in the mtcars dataset:

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(cyl)) +
  geom_bar()
```

###  Line charts: `geom_line()`

A line plot connects points with straight lines, from left-to-right. Especially useful if time is on the x-axis.

Required aesthetics:

 * `x`: a variable having some ordering to it.
 * `y`: a numeric variable.
 
Although not required, the `group` aesthetic will come in handy here. This aesthetic produces a plot independently for each group, and overlays the results (i.e., a separate line for each group).

```{r}
tsibble::as_tsibble(co2) %>% 
  rename(yearmonth = index,
         conc = value) %>% 
  mutate(month = lubridate::month(yearmonth, label = TRUE),
         year  = lubridate::year(yearmonth)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, conc)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = year), alpha = 0.5) +
  ylab("CO2 Concentration")
```

### Path plots: `geom_path()`

Like `geom_line()`, except connects points in the order that they appear in the dataset.
